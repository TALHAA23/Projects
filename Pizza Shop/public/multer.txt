Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency. Multer adds a `file` or `files` object to the request object, which contains the uploaded files. You can also access the text fields of the form in the `body` object.

Multer has several methods and options to customize how it handles the file uploads. Some of the methods are:

- `single(fieldname)`: Accepts a single file with the name `fieldname`. The single file will be stored in `req.file`.
- `array(fieldname[, maxCount])`: Accepts an array of files, all with the name `fieldname`. Optionally error out if more than `maxCount` files are uploaded. The array of files will be stored in `req.files`.
- `fields(fields)`: Accepts a mix of files, specified by `fields`. An object with arrays of files will be stored in `req.files`.
- `none()`: Accepts only text fields. No files will be accepted. Only use this if you want to handle multipart forms as text fields.
- `any()`: Accepts all files that comes over the wire. An array of files will be stored in `req.files`.

Some of the options are:

- `dest` or `storage`: Where to store the files
- `fileFilter`: Function to control which files are accepted
- `limits`: Limits of the uploaded data such as file size, number of files, etc.
- `preservePath`: Keep the full path of files instead of just the base name
